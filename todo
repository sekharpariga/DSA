Misson:

	To study and document all the great algorithms out there in the computer and programming world.
	some of the examples of great algorithms are
		1. Dijkstra's Algorithm (shortest path find for graphs)



Pending:

 1. Add CMakeLists.txt file
 2. Setup gihub commit actions
 3. DFS
 4. Digits DP
 5. Spanning tree
 6. 




Done:
