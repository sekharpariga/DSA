Tips and Tricks for writting better and faster c++ code

1. builtin fuctions
    __gcd(x, y)  --> return gcd of a, b
    __builtin_popcount(x)  --> returns number of set bits for x (number of 1's in x)
    
    a. use "\n" instead of endl
    b. use auto key word and range based for loop
        for(auto v: container)
            cout << v << "\n";
            
    c. calculate number of digits in x
        floor(log10(x) + 1
        
    d. string as stack ( s.push_back() , s.pop_back() ) all this functions are builtin
    
    e. bit manipulations using bitset
    
    f. check if a number is power of two
    
         bool powerof2(int x)
            return x && !( x & (x -1) )
     g. least significant bit of given number  eg. 4 (100) -4 
        return x & (-x)

2. fast input/output creation

    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(NULL);


3. Assign value by a pair of {} to container 

    braces {} can be used to initialize various containers like pair, vector, deque etc very easily as shown below.

    a.
    pair<int, int> p;

    Instead of : p = make_pair(3, 4);
    you can just do this: p = {3, 4};

    b. Initialize a vector as
    vector<int> v;
    v = {1, 2, 5, 2};

    c. Initialize a set as
    set<int> s;
    s = {4, 6, 2, 7, 4};
